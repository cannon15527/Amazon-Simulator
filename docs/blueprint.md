## Style Guidelines:

- A light color scheme that emphasizes playfulness and ease of use. The primary brand color is a vibrant orange (#FF951A), reflecting energy and an e-commerce vibe. The background uses a subtle, warm off-white (#FCF9F6) derived from the primary hue for a clean, friendly appearance. A clear, slightly bright blue (#2696D9) serves as the accent, providing strong contrast for key interactive elements.
- Headlines use 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif, for a modern and precise aesthetic, suitable for product names and section titles. Body text, such as item descriptions and status updates, uses 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, chosen for its excellent readability and balanced personality.
- Utilize a consistent set of line-art icons that are clean, modern, and universally recognizable for e-commerce functions like shopping carts, user profiles, and tracking statuses.
- A responsive, grid-based layout for product displays ensures a familiar browsing experience. Clear segmentation between sections for cart, orders, and addresses provides intuitive navigation and information hierarchy.
- Incorporate subtle animations for user feedback, such as item additions to the cart, successful purchases, and 'Prime' subscription confirmations, to enhance the interactive and playful nature of the simulation.
